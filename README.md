STAR DAO PROJECT ISLAND â€“ DEPLOYMENT ENGINE CORE MECHANISM (DRAFT)

This document outlines the core system logic of the STAR DAO Deployment Island project. It is based on the founding statements and is intended to support visual presentations and future system design.

1. Overall Objective

To build an open platform that enables modular smart contracts, automated deployment services, and a fair reward-sharing mechanism.

Users can submit code, images, or ideas.

The system provides automated feedback and formal deployment options.

Governance is DAO-based and open.

2. Main Flow Structure

2.1 User Submission Process

Submit core content (e.g., .py code, images, documents, concepts).

Optional assisted file generation (may require fees).

Simulated deployment (paid; supports trial & error).

Official deployment (tiered pricing based on duration).

Results and feedback returned to the user.

2.2 Modular Division of Labor

All technical processesâ€”deployment, verification, optimizationâ€”are handled by modular components.

Platform-built modules: Native services managed by the system.

User-contributed modules: Extensions created and uploaded by users.

Revenue is split based on module usage:

Platform module income goes to the platform.

User-contributed module income goes to its creator(s).

3. Pricing & Revenue Distribution

3.1 Points-Based Pricing

$1 = 10,000 points

Simulated Deployment: ~100 points (subject to adjustment)

Official Deployment:

2 minutes = 200 points

10 minutes = 500 points

30 minutes = 1000 points

3.2 Profit Distribution (After Server and Basic Costs)

40% â†’ Main Island

5% â†’ Project Island Leader

10% â†’ Project Development Fund

40% â†’ Governance, Module, and Platform contributors

5% â†’ Capital Investors (if applicable)
